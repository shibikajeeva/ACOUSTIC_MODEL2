# üéôÔ∏è Audio Input Test & Speech Recognition Prototype

## Overview

This notebook serves as a prototype for recording and recognizing speech through a user‚Äôs microphone. It may be used for experimenting with speech capture, voice-based interaction, or preparing data for more advanced speech processing tasks.

## Key Components

- **Microphone Access:** Captures audio input using `speech_recognition` and `pyaudio`.
- **Speech Transcription:** Converts spoken words into text using an external speech recognition API.
- **Testing Environment:** Simple, cell-by-cell execution within a Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation and customization.

## Installation

1. **Install required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install speechrecognition pyaudio
    ```

2. **Optional libraries** (depending on the scope of your test):
    ```bash
    pip install numpy wave
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the file `Untitled0 (1).ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Run each cell step by step.
3. Speak into the microphone when prompted.
4. Review the output ‚Äî the recognized text or any debugging output shown.

## Plain Explanation

This project is like a testing room for teaching your computer how to listen. It doesn‚Äôt have all the smart tools yet, but it helps you:

- Try out voice input
- See if your microphone and speech recognition work correctly
- Build a foundation for more advanced voice-enabled systems

You can imagine it as the "scratchpad" where voice features are being tested before building a full system.
